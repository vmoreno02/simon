                Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill. 
                The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires 
                a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the 
                series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the 
                user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The 
                original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton 
                Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley.
                Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and 
                was an immediate success, becoming a pop culture symbol of the 
                1970s and 1980s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">Info
